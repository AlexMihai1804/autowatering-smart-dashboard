# Growing Environment Characteristic (UUID: defe)

> Operation Summary
| Operation | Payload | Size | Fragmentation | Notes |
|-----------|---------|------|---------------|-------|
| Read | `struct growing_env_data` | 71 B | None | Snapshot for the last selected channel; defaults to channel 0 on CCC enable |
| Write | Channel select byte | 1 B | None | Updates cached channel context only; no notification |
| Write | Fragmented update | 4 B header + payload | Custom (write-only header) | Header `ch, type, size` then raw payload fragments; completes at declared size |
| Write | Full struct update | >=71 B | None | First 71 bytes parsed as struct; extra bytes ignored |
| Notify | `struct growing_env_data` | 71 B | None | Emitted after successful struct write (direct or fragmented) |

Growing Environment stores the per-channel agronomic configuration used by automatic irrigation calculations. The handlers live in `read_growing_env`, `write_growing_env`, `notify_growing_env`, and `growing_env_ccc_changed` inside `src/bt_irrigation_service.c`. Updates flow straight into `watering_channel_t` instances and are persisted through `watering_save_config_priority(true)` (debounced at 250 ms).

Little-endian encoding is used for all multi-byte fields. The union at offset 6 always occupies four bytes; clients must zero the unused members.

## Read Path (`read_growing_env`)
- Copies the current shared buffer (`growing_env_value`) to discover the selected channel; falls back to channel 0 if the cached value is invalid.
- Calls `watering_get_channel()` and mirrors the live configuration into a local struct before returning. Enhanced indices, coverage data, automatic mode flags, planting data, latitude, and sun exposure are refreshed on every read.
- Legacy fields remain zeroed except when the channel is configured for a custom plant (`PLANT_TYPE_OTHER`); in that case the custom plant block is populated from `channel->custom_plant`.
- If the channel lookup fails, the handler fills the struct with conservative defaults (indices unset, 1 m^2 coverage, manual mode, 10 L limit, latitude 45.0, sun 75%).
- Returns the packed struct via `bt_gatt_attr_read`; no fragmentation header is prepended.

## Write Path (`write_growing_env`)

### 1. Channel Selection (length = 1)
- Treats the single byte as a channel id. Values outside `[0, WATERING_CHANNELS_COUNT)` return `-EINVAL`.
- On success, caches the id in `growing_env_last_channel`, refreshes the global buffer with the live channel contents, and exits without touching storage or notifications.
- Use this before a read to fetch non-zero channels when notifications are disabled.

### 2. Fragmented Update (header + payload)
- First frame must be at least four bytes: `byte0 = channel_id`, `byte1 = frag_type`, `byte2/3 = total size` (endianness depends on `frag_type`: `2` = big-endian, `3` = little-endian).
- Declared size must be `<= sizeof(struct growing_env_data)` (71); larger sizes are rejected.
- Header initializes `growing_env_frag` (128-byte staging buffer) and copies any accompanying payload bytes.
- Continuation frames contain payload only. The handler appends up to the declared size and ignores surplus bytes.
- A 5 s watchdog (`FRAGMENTATION_TIMEOUT_MS`) clears partial state if fragments stop arriving.
- After `received >= expected`, the assembled struct is validated (channel bounds, mode range, indices, latitude, volume limit, and coverage constraints). Violations return `-EINVAL` and abort the update.
- On success the struct is applied to the channel (only enhanced fields, coverage, auto settings, planting data, latitude, sun exposure, and custom plant block when `plant_type == PLANT_TYPE_OTHER`). Legacy scalar bytes (plant_type/soil_type/etc.) are not written back.
- The global buffer is updated, configuration is scheduled for persistence via `watering_save_config_priority(true)`, and `notify_growing_env()` dispatches a Normal-priority notification.

### 3. Direct Struct Write (length >= 71)
- For MTUs large enough, the handler casts the incoming buffer to `struct growing_env_data` (ignoring extra bytes) and runs the same validation and apply logic as the fragmented path.
- Any write shorter than 71 bytes is rejected with `-EINVAL`.

`offset` and `flags` parameters are not supported; all writes must start at offset 0.

## Notifications (`notify_growing_env` / `growing_env_ccc_changed`)
- Notifications send the 71-byte struct exactly as stored in `growing_env_value` with Normal priority throttling through `advanced_notify`.
- CCC enable seeds the buffer with channel 0 (or sensible defaults if `watering_get_channel(0)` fails) but does **not** emit an automatic notification; clients should issue a read or full write after enabling notifications.
- CCC disable clears the shared buffer to zeros.
- Logging for notifications is rate-limited to one message every 30 s.

## Validation Matrix
| Field | Validation | Failure Result |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| `channel_id` | `< WATERING_CHANNELS_COUNT` | `-EINVAL` |
| `auto_mode` | `<= 2` | `-EINVAL` |
| `sun_exposure_pct` | `<= 100` | `-EINVAL` |
| `plant_db_index` | `< PLANT_FULL_SPECIES_COUNT` or `0xFFFF` | `-EINVAL` |
| `soil_db_index` | `< SOIL_ENHANCED_TYPES_COUNT` or `0xFF` | `-EINVAL` |
| `irrigation_method_index` | `< IRRIGATION_METHODS_COUNT` or `0xFF` | `-EINVAL` |
| `latitude_deg` | `-90.0 <= value <= 90.0` | `-EINVAL` |
| `max_volume_limit_l` | `>= 0.0` | `-EINVAL` |
| `coverage.area_m2` | `> 0.0` when `use_area_based != 0` | `-EINVAL` |
| `coverage.plant_count` | `> 0` when `use_area_based == 0` | `-EINVAL` |

## Client Guidance
- Always supply all 71 bytes when performing struct writes; zero the fields you do not control so firmware validation has defined inputs.
- Use the channel-select byte to stage a read for channels other than zero; the cached id is also used for subsequent notifications.
- Do not interleave fragmented updates with other writes. Start a new fragmentation session only after the previous one succeeds or times out (5 s).
- Legacy scalar fields (`plant_type`, `soil_type`, `irrigation_method`, `sun_percentage`, `specific_plant`) are currently ignored on write and reported as zeros on read. Rely on enhanced database indices instead.
- After a successful write, expect a single notification carrying the new struct. Issuing an immediate read is still recommended to confirm the persisted values.

### ⚠️ auto_mode and Compensation Behaviour
The `auto_mode` field determines how the channel calculates water requirements and whether external compensation is applied:

| auto_mode | Name | Type | Rain Skip | Temp Comp | Description |
|-----------|------|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `0` | Manual | TIME/VOLUME | ✅ Applied | ✅ Applied | Fixed duration or volume, uses compensation |
| `1` | Quality | FAO-56 | ❌ Not applied | ❌ Not applied | Calculates 100% of ET₀-based requirement |
| `2` | Eco | FAO-56 | ❌ Not applied | ❌ Not applied | Calculates 70% of ET₀-based requirement |

**Why no compensation for FAO-56 modes?** Quality and Eco modes use Penman-Monteith or Hargreaves-Samani equations which already incorporate temperature and rainfall in ET₀ calculations. Applying additional compensation would double-count these environmental factors.

## Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Likely Cause | Mitigation |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Write rejected with `-EINVAL` before completion | Fragment header declared size > 71 or channel id invalid | Recalculate header and retry |
| Write rejected after final fragment | Validation failure (coverage zero, latitude out of range, etc.) | Inspect the last fragment payload and fix invalid fields |
| Fragmentation times out | >5 s gap between fragments | Restart the transfer from the header frame |
| Notification not received after channel select | Channel select does not trigger notify | Issue a read or send a full struct write |
| Legacy fields always read as zero | Handler currently ignores legacy scalar bytes | Use enhanced indices and custom plant block |
