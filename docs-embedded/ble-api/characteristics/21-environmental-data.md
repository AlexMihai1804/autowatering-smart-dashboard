# Environmental Data Characteristic (UUID: 12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcde15)

> Operation Summary
| Operation | Payload | Size | Fragmentation | Notes |
|-----------|---------|------|---------------|-------|
| Read | `struct environmental_data_ble` | 24 B | None | Processed BME280 snapshot |
| Notify | `struct environmental_data_ble` | 24 B | 3-byte `[seq,total,len]` header (see below) | Normal-priority queue (~=200 ms throttle) |
| Write | - | - | - | Interface is read/notify only |

## Characteristic Metadata
- **Properties:** Read, Notify (no write)
- **Payload Size:** 24 bytes, little-endian, IEEE-754 floats
- **Notification Priority:** `NOTIFY_PRIORITY_NORMAL` (shared scheduler, inter-fragment delay 20 ms)
- **Fragmentation:** Single frame is attempted when `sizeof(payload) <= ATT_MTU-3`, but the pooled notifier only accepts payloads up to 23 bytes. The firmware therefore falls back to the fragmenting path, where each fragment begins with `uint8_t seq`, `uint8_t total`, `uint8_t len` followed by payload bytes.

## Payload Layout (`struct environmental_data_ble`)
| Offset | Field | Type | Meaning |
|--------|-------|------|---------|
| 0 | `temperature` | `float` | deg C from processed pipeline (fallback to raw driver if needed) |
| 4 | `humidity` | `float` | %RH |
| 8 | `pressure` | `float` | hPa |
| 12 | `timestamp` | `uint32_t` | Unix seconds (processed sample or uptime fallback) |
| 16 | `sensor_status` | `uint8_t` | 1 when any reading considered valid, 0 otherwise |
| 17 | `measurement_interval` | `uint16_t` | Seconds from persisted BME280 config (default 60) |
| 19 | `data_quality` | `uint8_t` | Validation score (0-100) clipped to sensor health |
| 20 | `reserved[4]` | `uint8_t[4]` | Always 0 |

Reads rebuild the struct on demand using `environmental_data_get_current()`. Notifications reuse the same helper and fall back to direct sensor reads when the processed cache is unavailable.

> **Implementation note:** The pooled notifier currently caps payloads at 23 bytes. Because the environmental payload is 24 bytes, the firmware fragments every notification even when the negotiated MTU could carry the whole struct. Clients should therefore always expect the 3-byte `[seq,total,len]` header until the pool limit is raised.
## Notification Behaviour
- Requires CCC enable. If notifications were previously disabled, no snapshot is pushed automatically.<br>- Because of the 23-byte limit mentioned above, current firmware always uses the fragmenting path. Assemble by concatenating payload slices in `seq` order until `seq + 1 == total` and `len` bytes have been copied for each fragment.<br>- Single-frame sends will become possible once the pooled notifier limit is raised; at that point the 3-byte header is omitted and the payload is delivered in one frame.<br>- Fragmented sends use direct `bt_gatt_notify` and respect a 20 ms sleep between fragments.

### Minimal Fragment Reassembly
```javascript
function handleEnvironmentalFragment(view) {
  if (view.byteLength === 24) {
    return view.buffer.slice(view.byteOffset, view.byteOffset + 24);
  }
  const seq = view.getUint8(0);
  const total = view.getUint8(1);
  const len = view.getUint8(2);
  return { seq, total, chunk: new Uint8Array(view.buffer, view.byteOffset + 3, len) };
}
```

## Data Quality Notes
- `sensor_status` is a coarse flag (0/1). Use `data_quality` for client-side warnings; firmware clamps it against `env_sensors_get_status()` overall health when available.
- Data quality derives from the validation pipeline; the BME280 does not expose gas metrics.

## Client Guidance
- Read operations always return 24 bytes; no long-read procedure is required.
- To keep pace with measurement intervals, subscribe to notifications and reassemble fragments when MTU constraints demand.<br>- Treat missing data (`sensor_status = 0`) as an indicator to fall back to cached values or suppress alerts.
- Developers can enable `CONFIG_ENV_SENSORS_SIM` to exercise this characteristic without hardware; the simulator drives deterministic temperature/humidity/pressure values that surface through the same payload.
