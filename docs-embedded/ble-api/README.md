# BLE API Documentation

This guide reflects the current Bluetooth Low Energy interface implemented in `src/bt_irrigation_service.c`. Previous speculative content, legacy Web Bluetooth samples, and stale UUID summaries have been removed.

## Connection Facts

- **Advertised name:** `AutoWatering` (`CONFIG_BT_DEVICE_NAME`)
- **Primary service UUID:** `12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef0`
- **Simultaneous links:** 1 peripheral connection (`CONFIG_BT_MAX_CONN=1`)
- **Pairing:** Optional, central-initiated. The firmware does not enforce a minimum security level; all characteristics remain accessible after a successful connection even without bonding.
- **Bond slots:** 1 (`CONFIG_BT_MAX_PAIRED=1`) for faster reconnects when the central opts to pair.
- **ATT MTU:** Zephyr negotiates up to the central's request. Application logic still caps write fragments at 20 payload bytes for compatibility; larger structs are transferred via fragmentation.

## Characteristic Inventory (Verified)

All characteristics live under the irrigation primary service. Properties come directly from the `BT_GATT_CHARACTERISTIC` declarations; sizes match the packed structs in `bt_gatt_structs.h` and `bt_gatt_structs_enhanced.h`.

## Fragmentation Rules

The firmware keeps 20-byte payload compatibility for writes even when a larger MTU is negotiated.

- **Channel Configuration / Growing Environment:** First fragment carries `[channel_id][frag_type][len_lo][len_hi]`. Fragment types 1 (name-only), 2 (big-endian struct), and 3 (little-endian struct) are supported; new tooling should prefer type 3.
- **Auto Calc Status:** Uses the generic `[0x00][frag_type][len_lo][len_hi]` header because it is not channel-scoped.
- **History responses (irrigation, rain, environmental):** Every fragment starts with the packed 8-byte `history_fragment_header_t` followed by up to 240 bytes of payload (`RAIN_HISTORY_FRAGMENT_SIZE`). Digest fields expose `fragment_index`, `total_fragments`, entry count, and status codes.
- **Notifications:** Managed through `SMART_NOTIFY`, `CRITICAL_NOTIFY`, and `CHANNEL_CONFIG_NOTIFY`. Adaptive throttling widens or shrinks the per-priority interval (critical 0 ms, high 50 ms, normal 200 ms, low 1000 ms) based on success and congestion counters. Channel name notifications are additionally rate-limited (maximum three within one second per channel).

## ATT Error Behaviour

| Error | Likely Cause | Client Action |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| `BT_ATT_ERR_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_LEN` | Fragment length mismatch, incorrect total size | Recalculate header and ensure first fragment declares the full struct length. |
| `BT_ATT_ERR_INVALID_OFFSET` | Long write with non-zero offset (not supported) | Always send fragments starting at offset 0. |
| `BT_ATT_ERR_VALUE_NOT_ALLOWED` | Channel out of range, unsupported reset type, or malformed enum | Validate inputs before writing. |
| `BT_ATT_ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES` | Notification buffer exhaustion | Back off and retry after the firmware logs buffer recovery. |
| `BT_ATT_ERR_UNLIKELY` | Stack-side transient | Retrying after a short delay is usually sufficient. |

## Tooling & Testing

- **nRF Connect (mobile or desktop):** Validated against the current service definition for manual read/write/notify testing.
- **Bleak (Python):** Recommended for scripted validation; maintains parity with fragmentation requirements.
- **Zephyr logging:** Enable `LOG_LEVEL_DBG` for `bt_irrigation_service` to observe fragment assembly, throttling decisions, and ATT errors during development.

## Status

Characteristic definitions, UUID mappings, and fragmentation notes in this document match the latest `main` branch (`bt_irrigation_service.c`, `bt_gatt_structs*.h`). Remaining action items live in `docs/ble-api/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` and will be updated as the characteristic deep-dive files are revalidated.
