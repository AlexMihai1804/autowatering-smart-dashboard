## Core Control Model

### Channel Matrix
- Eight irrigation channels (`WATERING_CHANNELS_COUNT`) are compiled into `watering_channels[]`.
- Each channel owns its GPIO descriptor, coverage definition, watering schedule, compensation settings, and persistent runtime state.
- Channel state includes: last watering epoch, days after planting, cached FAO-56 metadata, master-valve mask, interval configuration, and configuration scoring.

### Mutual Exclusion
- `MAX_SIMULTANEOUS_VALVES` is fixed at 1 so only one zone valve is energised at any time.
- The master valve layer (`master_valve_config_t`) wraps every operation with:
  - Pre-start delay: default +3 s
  - Post-stop delay: default +2 s
  - Overlap grace window: 5 s (keeps master open between consecutive tasks)

### Task Pipeline
- All watering work goes through the Zephyr message queue `watering_tasks_queue` (depth 10).
- The scheduler thread refuses to push additional scheduled jobs when two or more tasks are already waiting, leaving space for manual or remote overrides.
- `watering_process_next_task()` promotes queued jobs to the execution thread, which tracks the active task in `watering_task_state`.

### Threading and Pacing
- `watering_start_tasks()` brings up two 2 kB threads:
  - Processing loop (`watering_task_fn`, published as `watering_task`)
  - Scheduler loop (`scheduler_task_fn`, published as `scheduler_task`)
- Sleep intervals keyed off `current_power_mode`:
  - Normal: 60 s
  - Energy-saving: 120 s
  - Ultra-low-power: 300 s

---

## Channel Configuration Catalog

### Identity and Hardware
- `watering_channel_t` stores:
  - Channel name (64 characters)
  - GPIO spec for the zone valve
  - Runtime state (`is_active`, `last_watering_time`)
- Master-valve participation controlled centrally by `master_valve_config_t`:
  - Enabled flag, GPIO, pre-start/post-stop delays, overlap grace window
  - Auto-management switch, active flag

### Scheduling Core
- `watering_event_t` defines the base schedule:
  - `schedule_type`: daily mask or periodic interval
  - `start_time`: hour/minute in local time
  - `watering_mode`: duration, volume, or automatic modes
  - Quantity unions (`duration_minutes` or `volume_liters`)
  - `auto_enabled`: scheduler toggle
- Schedules stored per channel in NVS and exposed via BLE Channel Configuration characteristic.

### Coverage and Agronomic Metadata
- Channels reference compiled databases by index:
  - `plant_db_index`: 0..222 (`UINT16_MAX` = unset)
  - `soil_db_index`: 0..14 (`UINT8_MAX` = unset)
  - `irrigation_method_index`: 0..14
- Coverage selects between area (`area_m2`) and plant count (`plant_count`).
- Legacy fields (`plant_type`, `soil_type`, `irrigation_method`, `coverage_legacy`, `plant_info`, `custom_plant`) remain for backward compatibility.

### Automatic Watering Parameters
- `auto_mode`: Quality (100%) or Eco (70%) FAO-56 outputs.
- `max_volume_limit_l`: caps any single automatic job.
- `enable_cycle_soak`: allows clients to flag soils that need cycle-and-soak strategies.
- Plant lifecycle tracking:
  - `planting_date_unix`: Unix timestamp when plants were established
  - `days_after_planting`: calculated field for FAO-56 crop coefficient staging
- `latitude_deg` and `sun_exposure_pct`: personalise evapotranspiration calculations.

### Compensation Settings
- Per-channel rain compensation:
  - `enabled`, `sensitivity`, `lookback_hours`, `skip_threshold_mm`, `reduction_factor`
- Per-channel temperature compensation:
  - `enabled`, `base_temperature` (default 20°C), `sensitivity` (default 0.05)
  - `min_factor` (default 0.5), `max_factor` (default 2.0)
- Snapshots of last applied adjustments:
  - `last_rain_compensation`: reduction percentage, skip flag
  - `last_temp_compensation`: compensation factor, adjusted requirement

### Interval Mode Settings
- Inline structure:
  - `watering_minutes`, `watering_seconds`
  - `pause_minutes`, `pause_seconds`
  - `phase_start_time`, `configured` flag
- Shadow copy (`interval_config_shadow`) compatible with API controllers:
  - `total_target`, `cycles_completed`, `currently_watering`
  - `phase_remaining_sec`

### Custom Soil Overlays
- `soil_config` toggles between standard database entries and full custom definition:
  - Name (32 chars), field capacity (%), wilting point (%)
  - Infiltration rate (mm/h), bulk density (g/cm³), organic matter (%)
- Custom values override database defaults inside FAO-56 water balance routines.

### Configuration Scoring
- `config_status` tracks completion flags for:
  - Basic setup (25% weight)
  - Growing environment (25% weight)
  - Compensation (20% weight)
  - Custom soil (15% weight)
  - Interval profile (15% weight)
- `configuration_score`: 0-100 powering onboarding feedback.
- `last_reset_timestamp`: records when maintenance cleared the configuration group.

### Global Toggles
- `auto_calc_enabled`, `auto_calc_interval_ms` (1–24 hours)
- `current_power_mode`, `system_initialized`, `system_status`
- Flow calibration: stored under NVS key 1000, accepted range 100–10,000 pulses/liter.

### Database Inventories
- Plant species: 223 entries (`PLANT_FULL_SPECIES_COUNT`)
- Enhanced soils: 15 types (`SOIL_ENHANCED_TYPES_COUNT`)
- Irrigation methods: 15 entries (`IRRIGATION_METHODS_COUNT`)
- Conversion scripts in `tools/` regenerate these tables from CSV.
- Optional external-flash binary format: `tools/csv2binary_flash.py` + `database_flash` (mounted at `/lfs/db/*.bin`).

## Sensor Stack and Telemetry

### Inventory
The production hardware assumes three physical sensors:
1. Pulse-based flow meter on the irrigation supply
2. Tipping-bucket rain gauge
3. BME280 environmental sensor (temperature, humidity, pressure)

No soil moisture probes are present in this build; related fields remain reserved for backward compatibility.

### Flow Sensor (Pulse Meter)
- **Hardware interface**: Devicetree node `water_flow_sensor` supplies port, pin, and active level; debounce configurable via `sensor_config.debounce_ms` (default 5 ms).
- **Data products**:
  - Atomic pulse count (`get_pulse_count()`)
  - Smoothed pulses-per-second rate (two-sample buffer updated every 10 s if ≥5 pulses arrived)
  - BLE notifications via Flow Sensor characteristic: triggered when cumulative pulse count advances by ≥100 or 30 s guard timer elapses
  - ISR schedules work item every 25 pulses
- **Configuration**: Calibration persisted under NVS key 1000, settable via `set_flow_calibration()` or Calibration Management characteristic. Accepted range: 100–10,000 pulses/liter (default from devicetree, fallback 450).
- **Safety & diagnostics**: `check_flow_anomalies()` runs ~1/sec. Raises:
  - `WATERING_STATUS_NO_FLOW` when a valve is open but pulses do not appear (≈5 s start grace) or stall for ≈3 s; performs up to 3 open/close recovery toggles, then aborts and retries after 1 hour up to 5 times, then enters `WATERING_STATUS_FAULT` until reset
  - `WATERING_STATUS_UNEXPECTED_FLOW` when ≥10 pulses arrive while all valves closed

### Rain Sensor (Tipping Bucket)
- **Hardware interface**: `rain_sensor_config_t.debounce_ms` (default 50 ms).
- **Configuration** (`rain_nvs_config_t`):
  - `mm_per_pulse` (default 0.2 mm)
  - `sensor_enabled`, `integration_enabled`
  - `rain_sensitivity_pct`, `skip_threshold_mm`
  - `last_reset_time`
- **Data products**:
  - Hourly rain history is flushed on UTC hour rollover via `rain_sensor_update_hourly()` into `rain_history` (LittleFS ring when external flash enabled).
  - Daily summaries are derived from hourly history (maintenance-driven aggregation).
  - BLE characteristics: 18-rain-sensor-config, 19-rain-sensor-data, 20-rain-history-control
  - Persistent counters (`rain_nvs_state_t`): total pulses, last pulse time, current hour/day totals
- **Health & diagnostics**:
  - Pulse statistics (mean/stddev of interval timing), outlier suppression, accuracy percentage, consecutive error counts
  - Watchdog (`check_rain_sensor_health()`) runs every 5 minutes: reinitialises sensor, history, and integration modules on failure; validates NVS payloads
- **Integration controls** (`rain_integration_config_t`):
  - `rain_sensitivity_pct`, `skip_threshold_mm`, `effective_rain_factor`, `lookback_hours`, `integration_enabled`

### Environmental Suite (BME280)
- **Hardware interface**: `sensor_manager_init_bme280()` initialises on primary I2C bus. Simulation paths behind `CONFIG_ENV_SENSORS_SIM` generate deterministic data.
- **Data products** (`environmental_data_t`):
  - Mean/min/max temperature, humidity, pressure
  - Rainfall over last 24 h
  - Derived dewpoint and vapour pressures
  - Measurement interval, timestamp, validity flags
  - Data quality score (0-100)
- **Configuration** (`env_sensor_config_t`):
  - Sensor enable flags
  - Measurement intervals: temp/humidity 15 min, rain 60 min (default)
  - Calibration offsets: `temp_offset_c`, `humidity_offset_pct`, `rain_calibration_factor`
  - Quality thresholds: `min_data_quality` (default 80), `max_sensor_age_min` (default 120)
- **Health & diagnostics** (`env_sensor_status_t`):
  - Sensor online flags, last successful timestamps
  - Per-sensor error counts, overall health score
  - BLE characteristics: 21-environmental-data, 22-environmental-history

### Derived Telemetry and Compensation

#### Rain Integration
- Combines recent rainfall (up to `lookback_hours`), soil infiltration (`effective_rain_factor`), and channel sensitivity.
- Produces `rain_irrigation_impact_t`:
  - Recent rainfall, effective rainfall
  - Reduction percentage, skip boolean
  - Confidence score
- Module caches last result per channel and emits diagnostics (success/failure counts, calculation success rate).

#### Rain Compensation Engine
- `rain_compensation_config_t` adds higher-level policies:
  - Algorithm selection: simple, proportional, exponential, adaptive
  - Reduction factors, skip thresholds, lookback hours
- Each calculation fills `rain_compensation_calculation_t`:
  - Effective rainfall, adjusted requirement
  - Reduction percent, skip flag, confidence, status

#### Temperature Compensation
- Channel-local configuration (`temperature_compensation_config_t`):
  - Base temperature (default 20°C)
  - Sensitivity (default 0.05)
  - Min/max factors (default 0.5–2.0)
- Runtime helpers: `temp_compensation_calculate()`, `temp_comp_should_apply()`
- **Temperature compensation applies only to TIME and VOLUME modes**.
- FAO-56 modes already incorporate temperature in ET₀ via Penman-Monteith or Hargreaves-Samani.
- Results stored in `last_temp_compensation` for BLE telemetry.

#### Enhanced System Status
- `enhanced_system_status_info_t` aggregates:
  - Active interval phases
  - Compensation state
  - Sensor health
  - Configuration completeness
  - Channel bitmaps (active, interval, incomplete)
  - Timestamps

---

## Watering Modes and Execution Lifecycle

### By Duration (`WATERING_BY_DURATION`)
- Channel valve held open for configured minutes.
- Interval mode can split runtime into alternating watering/pause phases when `interval_config.configured` is true.
- Completion determined by elapsed time minus paused intervals.
- Flow monitoring active for anomaly detection only.

### By Volume (`WATERING_BY_VOLUME`)
- Firmware targets specific litres.
- Before opening valve, resets flow pulse counter.
- Completion: `pulses * 1000 / calibration` meets litre target (minimum 1 litre enforced).
- Interval mode supported; adjusts litres per phase accordingly.

### Automatic Quality (`WATERING_AUTOMATIC_QUALITY`)
- Channels in Quality mode eligible for automatic FAO-56 calculations.
- `watering_run_automatic_calculations()` snapshots existing event, converts computed requirement into one-off volume job (100% of FAO-56 result, minimum 1 litre), and queues it.

### Automatic Eco (`WATERING_AUTOMATIC_ECO`)
- Same process as Quality mode but delivers 70% of FAO-56 requirement.

### Interval Mode Integration
- `interval_task_should_use_interval()` validates interval profile and ensures watering mode is duration or volume based.
- `interval_controller_t` orchestrates:
  - Watering/pause phases
  - Cycle counting
  - Phase time calculation
  - Progress via enhanced BLE task characteristic
- Manual pause/resume/stop commands interact with controller and keep master valve in sync.
- State machine states: IDLE, WATERING, PAUSING, COMPLETED, ERROR.

### Rain-Aware Execution
- Before task starts, `rain_integration_calculate_impact()` recomputes skip flag and percentage reduction.
- **Rain Skip and Reduction apply ONLY to TIME and VOLUME modes**.
- FAO-56 modes skip this step (rain already in ET₀ calculations).
- Skipped tasks restore snapshots and log rain-skip history entry.
- Partial reductions adjust duration or volume but never below 1 minute or 1 litre.

### Task Completion
- On completion (success or error):
  - Log actual duration/volume
  - Raise BLE notifications
  - Restore original event configuration
  - Free queue slot
- Master-valve logic: close immediately or after configured delay (if another task pending within overlap window).

---

## Scheduling and Time Base

### RTC Anchoring
- Each scheduler pass obtains wall-clock time from DS3231 RTC and converts to local time via `timezone` helpers.
- If RTC fails five times in a row, system temporarily falls back to uptime estimates until RTC recovers.

### Day Tracking
- When day component changes:
  - `days_since_start` increments
  - Configuration saved to NVS
  - Periodic schedules test modulo condition

### Queue Policies
- Scheduled jobs enqueued only when:
  - Current local hour/minute matches `event.start_time`
  - Day mask or periodic interval condition satisfied
- Manual jobs bypass scheduler and go straight into queue if space allows.

### Power-Aware Sleeping
- After every scheduling pass, thread sleeps for 60/120/300 s depending on active power mode.

---

## Automatic Irrigation Calculation Pipeline

### 1. Trigger Cadence
- Scheduler verifies `auto_calc_enabled` is true.
- At least `auto_calc_interval_ms` (default 1 hour, configurable 1–24 hours) elapsed since last run.

### 2. Eligibility
- Channels in Quality or Eco mode without active task are candidates.

### 3. Environmental Inputs
- `env_sensors_read()` supplies latest measurements.
- If parameter invalid, pipeline substitutes safe defaults (20°C, 60% RH) or aborts channel when no reliable data available.

### 4. FAO-56 Computation
`fao56_calculate_irrigation_requirement()` performs:

#### Reference Evapotranspiration (ET₀)
- Retrieve cached ET₀ when same inputs processed recently.
- Otherwise compute Penman-Monteith using temperature, humidity, pressure, latitude, day-of-year.
- If humidity or pressure missing, fall back to Hargreaves-Samani (temperature-only) but mark result as fallback.

#### Crop Coefficient
- Combine plant database entries (stage lengths, Kc values) with `days_after_planting`.
- Values cached per channel to avoid recomputation in same session.
- Legacy plant-type data used only when database indices unset.

#### Soil Water Balance
- If plant/soil/method indices valid: `calc_water_balance()` computes:
  - Readily available water (RAW)
  - Total available water (TAW)
  - Current deficit
  - Net irrigation requirement
- Uses custom soil overrides where present.
- If dataset missing: degrades to simplified deficit model (ETc minus effective rainfall).

#### Effective Rainfall
- Hourly/daily rain history plus `rain_integration_calculate_effective_rainfall()` determine offset.
- Effective rain factor (default 0.8) and rain integration toggle influence this step.

#### Volume Conversion
- Convert mm irrigation into litres using:
  - Area coverage (`area_m2`), or
  - Implicit per-plant area (default 0.5 m²)
- Apply Eco reductions (70%) and enforce `max_volume_limit_l`.
- Track cycle-and-soak flag for scheduling strategies.
- Record `last_calculation_time` and update channel water balance caches.

### 5. Task Materialisation
- Controller snapshots existing event.
- Converts FAO-56 recommendation into temporary `WATERING_BY_VOLUME` task (minimum 1 litre).
- Enqueues task; if queue full, restores snapshot and logs error.

### 6. Compensation Behaviour by Mode
- **TIME/VOLUME modes**: Rain Skip, Rain Reduction, and Temperature Compensation applied (per-channel thresholds).
- **Quality/Eco modes (FAO-56)**: Compensation **NOT applied** – FAO-56 already incorporates rain and temperature in ET₀. Applying additional compensation would double-count.

### 7. Notifications
- When at least one channel schedules successfully, `bt_irrigation_auto_calc_status_notify()` informs connected BLE clients.

---

## Data Persistence and Storage Layout

### NVS Footprint
Stored via `nvs_config` helpers (each validates payload size before committing):
- Channel configuration, custom soil overlays
- Onboarding flags, schedule flags
- System flags: flow calibration, master valve, RTC, rain sensor, power mode, location, initial setup
- Automatic calculation state
- Timezone configuration
- Days since start

### External Flash + LittleFS (W25Q128)
When `CONFIG_HISTORY_EXTERNAL_FLASH=y`, a LittleFS volume is mounted on `database_partition` at `/lfs` and used for:
- Environmental + rain history ring files (`/lfs/history/*.bin`) via `history_flash`
- Optional binary plant/soil/irrigation databases (`/lfs/db/*.bin`) via `database_flash` (generated by `tools/csv2binary_flash.py`)

### Watering History
- **Detailed events** (30 per channel, 15 bytes each):
  - `dt_delta`, trigger type, success/error flags
  - Target ml/minutes, actual ml
  - Average flow rate, reserved bytes
- **Daily stats** (90 entries, 16 bytes):
  - Day epoch, total ml
  - Sessions ok/error, success rate
  - Busiest channel
- **Monthly stats** (36 entries, 12 bytes):
  - Year, month, total ml
  - Active days, peak channel
- **Annual stats** (10 entries, 20 bytes):
  - Year, total ml, total sessions, errors
  - Max/min month ml, peak channel
- Insights cache and rotation metadata persist alongside ring buffers.

### Rain History
- Stored in LittleFS via `history_flash` when `CONFIG_HISTORY_EXTERNAL_FLASH=y` (default); otherwise stored in NVS blobs.
- Hourly entries are appended on UTC hour rollover (rain sensor updater) and retained as a 30-day ring (720 hours).
- **Hourly records** (720 entries, 8 bytes):
  - Hour epoch, rainfall in 0.01 mm units
  - Raw pulse count, data quality (0-100)
- **Daily records** (1,825 entries, 12 bytes):
  - Day epoch, total rainfall
  - Peak hourly rainfall, hours with activity
  - Completeness percentage
- Total pulses and last pulse timestamps retained in NVS.

### Environmental History

  - Rainfall mm, watering events count
  - Total volume ml, active-channel bitmap
- **Daily entries** (372):
  - Min/max/avg temperature, humidity, pressure
  - Total rainfall, watering events, total volume
  - Sample count, active-channel bitmap
- **Monthly entries** (60):
  - YYYYMM, aggregated stats
  - Total rainfall, watering events, total volume
  - Active days
- Aggregation is scheduler-driven via `env_history_auto_aggregate()` (runs each scheduler tick, emits the last completed hour and rolls up daily/monthly on boundary changes).

### Storage Health
- `nvs_storage_monitor`:
  - Mounts partition, calculates used/free bytes
  - Counts read and write errors
  - Schedules clean-up runs: returns usage to ~70% once 80/90% thresholds crossed
- External flash history: `history_flash_get_stats()` reports per-file counts and byte usage; LittleFS provides wear levelling and integrity checks.
- BLE characteristic exposes current health message and utilisation percentage.

### Onboarding/Reset Logs
- `onboarding_state` stores:
  - Channel config flags (8 channels × 8 bits each)
  - Extended channel flags (FAO-56 ready, rain comp, temp comp, latitude, volume limit, planting date, cycle-soak)
  - System flags, schedule bitmask
  - Timestamps, completion percentage
- `config_reset_log_t` (16-entry rings per channel):
  - Reset group, timestamp, channel, reason string
- Reset controller confirmation codes:
  - Requested scope, channel ID, code
  - Generation time, expiry (5 minutes)

## Limitations and Behaviour Notes

### Compensation Engines
- Rain and temperature compensation APIs available for **TIME and VOLUME watering modes only**.
- **FAO-56 modes (Quality/Eco) do NOT use external compensation** because they already incorporate rain and temperature in ET₀ calculations.
- Applying compensation on top of FAO-56 would result in double-counting.

### Interval Mode
- Interval profiles only control execution cadence; they do not schedule jobs on their own.
- Users must still create duration or volume tasks.
- Only compatible with TIME and VOLUME modes.

### Master Valve Manual Mode
- When automatic master valve management disabled, clients must open and close master valve explicitly.
- Manual toggles rejected while auto-management enabled.

### History Rotation
- Watering history rotation is scaffolded (NVS-backed).
- Rain/environment history rotation is handled by fixed-size ring files when `CONFIG_HISTORY_EXTERNAL_FLASH=y`.
- Extremely full NVS partitions might require manual clean-up via reset commands.

### Hardware Requirements
- Tested targets: nRF52840 (promicro_nrf52840, arduino_nano_33_ble)
- Simulation: native_sim with emulated RTC, GPIO, and BLE (requires a host GCC toolchain)
- Storage: NVS for configuration + watering history; W25Q128 (16 MB) external SPI flash for LittleFS-backed rain/environment history when enabled
